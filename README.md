### Steps to clone: 
Please make sure to follow steps listed here to get a repo cloned: https://github.com/PuMProfessionals/github-git-practice

Everything else should pretty much be the exact same up to the cloning part. Please make sure you can list `npm start` on your command line. On your browser it should appear:

  <h3> About Storybook </h3>
Before using this UI library, I highly recommend the documentation here: https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction about what Storybook is and how it works. Generally, for each component, you have a "story" for them. This allows you to view the component as a UI piece, so we do not break future applications! The idea is to get a component working at a time so we can later reuse. We want to code as little as possible for our sake and for future maintenance's sake!

Current version of Storybook deployed can be found: https://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=602c32c50baee80023c0351b&groupPrefix=Example using Chromatic.

<h3> Possible causes for errors in cloning: </h3>
- Not having the proper node modules installed: please type in `npm install`; if the command does not work make sure that you have installed `node` (steps in the above link) so you can get access to the `node package manager`
